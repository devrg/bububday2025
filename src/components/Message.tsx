    <p>
      Today is your birthday, and I want you to be happy and always smile on your way ahead! So many things happened this year; good things, bad things, and some things that make you feel alive. I want you to keep a smiling face and face anything life throws at you. I want you to be the cutest human being in my life and be that dustu mishti girl who always makes me smile whenever I see you. Never change, my love ❤️.
